In turn, the Introducing Broker earns commission for every active trader that has been referred by him/her (recorded thanks to our affiliate links). Companies that want to act as an IB for us will get a status of Official SuperForex Representatives for a given city or region, and their company information will be placed on our official website.</p>
        <blockquote cite="#" style="color: #444;">
          As an IB you will be compensated for introducing new clients to SuperForex. We will provide you with a complete range of solutions to do business, including promotional materials, trading platforms, and transaction execution tools.

        <p>As a rule, our IBs receive additional rewards for representing SuperForex on a local level.</p>
