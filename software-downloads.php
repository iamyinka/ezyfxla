      </div>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8">
        <p>Trading today involves a much wider view of the markets with a far wider range of tradable assets than ever before. Nobody really likes compromising and certainly, nobody likes to have to compromise their trading strategies. We’ve never really been huge fans of compromise ourselves so why force our traders into compromising their trading?</p>

        <p>You already know about the huge range of assets we offer and all our traders rave about our trade execution. Rightly so in our opinion, since great trades are made by great execution.</p>

        <p>What some of you might not be aware of is the range of trading platforms we support.</p>

        <p>Forex and CFD traders have access to our award-winning MetaTrader 4.

Packed with features such as advanced order types, charting, and custom indicators, MT4 is hugely popular with all our traders, no matter what their trading styles.</p>

        <p>MetaTrader 4 has a very active following for traders using EAs (Expert Advisers), as the built-in programming language MQL4 has all the hooks and functions need to create automated trading systems as well as custom indicators to use on the MT4 charts.</p>
